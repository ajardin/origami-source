`origami` is designed to help you manage local Docker environments for PHP applications.

It allows among other things to: install a complete environment in a project, start/stop/restart it, visualize the
services logs, display the services status, go inside a service, etc. It also offers the ability to have a global
overview of all installed environments and to perform the actions mentioned above without having to be in the project
directory.

Basically, `origami` is an abstraction of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). But because Docker can be
[painfully slow on macOS](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1592) with projects which contain a large number of
files, there is an abstraction of [Mutagen](https://mutagen.io/) to improve I/O performance. And because the HTTPS has
become the norm, there is also an abstraction of [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to make locally trusted
development certificates.

### Disclaimer

As `origami` is still in its earlier stages, **the compatibility with other operating systems than macOS is not
guaranteed**, for the moment. The support of Linux and Windows could come in the near future.

## üîç Architecture

`origami` is built on top of [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), a popular PHP framework.

Unlike common Symfony projects, we use [Box](https://github.com/humbug/box/) to package the tool into a single binary
file. So that it's possible to easily share it without installing all its dependencies, as it could potentially bring
conflicts if other projects with outdated dependencies are already globally installed on the local machine.

**Why PHP?** The main reason is that `origami` will focus on environments for PHP applications (Magento & Symfony at
first), and we would like to facilitate the contributions process by using something well-known by our users.
